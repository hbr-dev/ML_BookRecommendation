# ðŸ“š Book Recommendation Algorithm

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project implements a book recommendation algorithm using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) technique. By analyzing user preferences and book features, the algorithm identifies similar books based on user ratings and attributes. The result is a personalized recommendation system that helps users discover new books tailored to their tastes, enhancing their reading experience.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm:** Utilizes KNN to find similar books based on user ratings and book characteristics.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Provides tailored book suggestions to users based on their reading history and preferences.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyzes datasets to extract meaningful insights and improve recommendation accuracy.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The project includes dataset files that contain information about books, user ratings, and user profiles. The datasets are essential for training and testing the recommendation algorithm.

### Dataset Files
- `BX-Books.csv`: Contains details about books, including titles, authors, genres, and descriptions.
- `BX-Books-Ratings.csv`: Includes user ratings for various books, which are used to train the KNN model.
- `BX-Users.csv`: Contains user information, including user IDs and demographic details, which can be used to enhance recommendation accuracy.
